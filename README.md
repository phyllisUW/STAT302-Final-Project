# STAT302-Final-Project

This project analyzes wireless ad hoc networks (like cell phone networks) to understand how communication connectivity changes based on broadcasting power levels. The core goal is to find the minimum power level needed to ensure all devices in a network can communicate with each other.


In this project, I create the following:

Generates Network Nodes: Creates random wireless device locations following a realistic density pattern 
Finds Critical Connectivity Radius (Rc): Determines the smallest broadcasting radius where the entire network becomes connected - meaning any device can reach any other device through a chain of connections
Analyzes Network Behavior: Studies how critical radius changes with different numbers of devices and examines the statistical patterns
